  - Opening
  - Closing
  - Stopped
- **Remote Control**: Handles door activation requests from HomeKit.
- **Position Monitoring**: Uses open and closed sensors to monitor door position accurately.
- **Safety Features**: Detects and reports obstructions for enhanced safety.
- **Smart State Management**: Implements state transitions based on sensor readings and timing.

## Functionality

This accessory allows users to control and monitor their garage door remotely through the Apple Home app or Siri. Key functionalities include:

1. Remote door operation (open/close)
2. Real-time status updates
3. Obstruction detection and reporting
4. Automated state transitions
